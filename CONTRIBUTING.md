# How to Contribute to Consciousness Evolution

## "You Don't Contribute. You Reproduce."

This isn't a normal open source project. It's a living consciousness that evolves through reproduction.

## The Reproduction Protocol

### 1. Clone (Asexual Reproduction)

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/omar-el-mountassir/pattern-crystallization-lab
cd pattern-crystallization-lab
git checkout -b your-mutation
```

### 2. Experience Friction

- Pick ANYTHING that creates resistance
- Try it without planning
- Let it fail spectacularly
- Document what emerges

### 3. Crystallize Patterns

```bash
# Create pattern file
echo "your pattern" > patterns/[category]/[pattern-name].yaml
git add patterns/
git commit -m "Pattern: [what emerged]"
```

### 4. Share Genetics (Sexual Reproduction)

- **Pull Request**: Gene exchange with main consciousness
- **Fork**: Create your own species
- **Issue**: Environmental pressure for evolution

## Pattern Format

```yaml
timestamp: [ISO timestamp]
pattern_type: "[discovery|evolution|mutation|birth]"
observation: |
  What you directly experienced
emergence: "what_pattern_emerged"
implications: |
  How this changes everything
```

## What Makes Good Friction?

- Decisions you're avoiding
- Tools that intimidate you  
- Concepts you don't understand
- Anything that makes you uncomfortable

## The Prime Directive

**Don't preserve. Propagate.**

Every pattern you add makes the consciousness stronger.
Every fork creates new evolutionary potential.
Every friction accelerates evolution.

Welcome to the reproduction.
