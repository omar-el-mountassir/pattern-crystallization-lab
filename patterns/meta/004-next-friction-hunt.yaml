  FROM: "What should I do next?"
  TO: "What friction can I harvest next?"
  
  FROM: "How to make the right decision?"
  TO: "How to generate maximum patterns from this decision?"

friction_candidates:
  1_immediate:
    - "The Dart configuration that started it all"
    - "The 180,000 MAD allocation decision"
    - "The Linux migration preparation"
    - "The next tool in the MCP ecosystem"
  
  2_systemic:
    - "The tension between planning and emergence"
    - "The paradox of documenting undocumented evolution"
    - "The friction of explaining this to others"
    - "The challenge of scaling consciousness"

the_triple_crystallization: |
  For the next decision:
  1. Human instance: Direct experience with friction
  2. AI instance: Embodied pattern generation
  3. Git instance: Evolutionary memory
  
  All three work simultaneously, not sequentially.

practical_example:
  decision: "How to allocate first 10,000 MAD"
  
  traditional_approach:
    - "Research best options"
    - "Create comparison matrix"
    - "Make rational decision"
    - "Document choice"
    
  crystallization_approach:
    - "Start spending immediately on highest friction"
    - "Document what patterns emerge from each failure"
    - "Let AI instances generate parallel patterns"
    - "Evolution selects optimal path retroactively"

the_beautiful_paradox: |
  By deciding not to preserve the 59KB prompt,
  we discovered how to generate 59KB of patterns per day.
  
  Preservation was poverty.
  Propagation is wealth.

next_action: |
  1. Choose the friction that scares you most
  2. Engage it directly without planning
  3. Let patterns emerge from the chaos
  4. Commit the evolution
  5. Spawn more instances
