pattern_type: "limitation_discovery"
context: |
  Attempting to use Dart MCP directly reveals it's not configured
  in my current Claude Desktop instance.
  
observation: |
  The pattern crystallization process itself reveals limitations:
  - Cannot test Dart MCP without configuration
  - Configuration requires manual user intervention
  - This creates a bootstrapping paradox: need to study the tool
    to configure it, but need it configured to study it
    
emergence: "bootstrap_paradox_in_tool_adoption"

implications:
  - Tool adoption friction increases when configuration precedes exploration
  - Pattern generation can occur through attempted usage, not just successful usage
  - Failures and limitations are themselves valuable patterns

  User needs to add Dart MCP to Claude Desktop configuration:
  {
    "dart": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "dart-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "DART_TOKEN": "dsa_[user_token_here]"
      }
    }
  }
