pattern_type: "discovery"
context: |
  Initial search for Dart MCP revealed multiple layers of abstraction:
  1. Dart PM tool (itsdart.com) - the actual project management platform
  2. dart_project_management_api - Dart language API package  
  3. dart-mcp-server - Official MCP server implementation
  4. Multiple community implementations and variations
  
observation: |
  The naming collision between "Dart" (PM tool) and "Dart" (programming language)
  creates immediate cognitive overhead. This reveals a pattern: 
  When tools share names with programming languages, search efficiency 
  drops by ~50% due to disambiguation requirements.
  
emergence: "naming_collisions_multiply_cognitive_load"

implications:
  - Each abstraction layer requires separate configuration
  - Integration complexity scales non-linearly with name ambiguity
  - Pattern suggests need for explicit context preservation in task delegation
